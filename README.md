This is my first GitHub repository.

So the other day I was just walking down the street and I thought to myself: Why do we call it walking down the stree? Why don't we call
it walking up the street? I mean, walking down the street the has such a negative connotation to it. Like, when we say walking up 
something, it usually includes increasing your altititude, like walking UP a hill or UP the stairs. So if one were to say walk down 
something in order to show a decrease in altitude, that would make sense. Saying something like walking down the stairs makes complete 
sense. But walking down the street? The street isn't always decreasing in altitude. Sometimes it's increasing in altitude. Most of the
time it's remaining at a constant altitude. This saying makes no sense whatsoever.
